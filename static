static   Keyword
In Java, static keyword is mainly used for memory management
When a member of the class is declared as static, it can be accessed before the objects of its class are created, and without any object reference.
It is a keyword which is used to share the same variable or method of a given class
Basically, static is used for a constant variable or a method that is same for every instance of a class.
When you declare a variable as static, then a single copy of the variable is created and divided among all objects at the class level. 
 It Execute before constructor and methods...
